LM Studio Provider - Local AI with OpenAI Compatibility

This module implements the LM Studio provider, which enables running large
language models locally while maintaining full compatibility with OpenAI's
API. LM Studio provides a user-friendly interface for local model management
with enterprise-grade API compatibility.

Key Features:
============

1. **OpenAI API Compatibility**: 100% compatible with OpenAI's chat completion API
2. **Local Execution**: Models run entirely on local hardware for privacy
3. **Model Management**: Intuitive GUI for downloading and managing models
4. **Hardware Optimization**: Automatic GPU acceleration with CUDA/Metal support
5. **Cost Control**: No API costs or usage limits
6. **Offline Operation**: Works without internet connectivity once models are loaded

Architecture Overview:
=====================

**Inheritance Strategy**: This provider inherits from OpenAIProvider to leverage
the comprehensive OpenAI implementation while adapting it for local use:

- **Code Reuse**: All OpenAI functionality works unchanged
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only overrides what's necessary for local operation
- **Maintenance**: Benefits from OpenAI provider improvements automatically
- **Compatibility**: Seamless switching between cloud and local providers

**API Compatibility Layer**: LM Studio exposes endpoints that exactly match
OpenAI's specification:

- `/v1/chat/completions`: Chat completion API
- `/v1/models`: Model listing API  
- `/v1/completions`: Legacy completion API (if needed)
- WebSocket streaming: Real-time response streaming

Design Philosophy:
=================

**Adapter Pattern**: This provider acts as an adapter between the Neuromancer
system and LM Studio's local API server:

```
Neuromancer -> LMStudioProvider -> OpenAIProvider -> LM Studio API -> Local Model
```

**Configuration Abstraction**: Simplifies local deployment configuration:

- Default localhost endpoint
- Automatic API version handling  
- Dummy authentication for compatibility
- Automatic service discovery

Deployment Scenarios:
====================

**Local Development**:
- Single machine deployment
- Default localhost:1234 endpoint
- Direct model access and management
- Instant feedback and iteration

**Distributed Teams**:
- Shared LM Studio server on network
- Custom host configuration
- Centralized model management
- Consistent development environment

**Enterprise Deployment**:
- Internal API server deployment
- Security policy compliance
- Resource pooling and management
- Audit logging and monitoring

Performance Characteristics:
===========================

**Model Loading**:
- First request: 10-60 seconds (model loading time)
- Subsequent requests: Near-instant (model cached in memory)
- Memory usage: 4-40GB depending on model size
- GPU acceleration: 3-10x speedup over CPU

**Response Times**:
- Local network latency: <10ms
- Token generation: 10-100 tokens/second
- Streaming latency: Minimal buffering
- Context processing: Scales with context length

**Resource Requirements**:
- RAM: 8-64GB (depends on model size)
- GPU: CUDA/Metal compatible for acceleration
- Storage: 4-40GB per model
- Network: Minimal (only for model downloads)

Configuration Patterns:
======================

**Default Local Setup**:
```python
# Uses localhost:1234 with dummy authentication
provider = LMStudioProvider()
```

**Custom Network Deployment**:
```python
# Points to shared LM Studio server
provider = LMStudioProvider(host="http://192.168.1.100:1234")
```

**Docker/Container Deployment**:
```python
# Container-to-container communication
provider = LMStudioProvider(host="http://lmstudio-container:1234")
```

**Development vs Production**:
```python
# Environment-based configuration
import os
host = os.getenv("LM_STUDIO_HOST", "http://localhost:1234")
provider = LMStudioProvider(host=host)
```

Model Management Integration:
============================

**Model Discovery**: Automatically detects loaded models in LM Studio:

- Queries `/v1/models` endpoint for active models
- Returns user-friendly model names
- Filters for chat-compatible models
- Updates dynamically as models are loaded/unloaded

**Model Lifecycle**: Integrates with LM Studio's model management:

- Models must be loaded in LM Studio GUI first
- Automatic detection of model changes
- Graceful handling of model switching
- Resource cleanup when models unloaded

Error Handling Specifics:
========================

**Service Detection**: Enhanced error handling for local services:

- Connection refused: LM Studio not running
- 404 errors: Incorrect endpoint configuration
- Model not found: No models loaded in LM Studio
- Resource errors: Insufficient memory/GPU resources

**Development Workflow**: Optimized error messages for development:

- Clear instructions for common setup issues
- Links to LM Studio documentation
- Troubleshooting steps for typical problems
- Performance optimization suggestions

Integration Examples:
====================

```python
# Basic setup
provider = LMStudioProvider()

# Check if LM Studio is running and has models
if await provider.health_check():
    models = await provider.list_models()
    print(f"Available models: {models}")
    
    # Use any OpenAI provider functionality
    response = await provider.complete(messages, models[0])
    print(response.content)

# Advanced configuration
provider = LMStudioProvider(
    host="http://gpu-server:1234",
    timeout=120.0  # Longer timeout for large models
)

# Streaming works identically to OpenAI
async for chunk in provider.stream_complete(messages, model):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

Monitoring and Debugging:
========================

**Health Monitoring**: Specific health checks for local deployment:

- Service availability detection
- Model loading status verification
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Performance baseline establishment

**Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging for local troubleshooting:

- LM Studio service status
- Model loading/unloading events
- Resource constraint detection
- Performance profiling data

Security Considerations:
=======================

**Local Network Security**:
- No authentication required for local access
- Network isolation recommended for production
- Firewall configuration for external access
- VPN access for remote team members

**Data Privacy**:
- All processing happens locally
- No data transmitted to external services
- Complete control over data handling
- Compliance with privacy regulations

**Resource Security**:
- Local hardware access control
- Model file system permissions
- Process isolation and sandboxing
- Resource limit enforcement

        List models currently loaded in LM Studio.
        
        This method queries LM Studio's model management API to get all
        models that are currently loaded and ready for inference. Unlike
        cloud providers, the model list reflects what's actually available
        in memory rather than what could potentially be accessed.
        
        Returns:
            list[str]: Currently loaded model identifiers
                      Examples: ["llama-2-7b-chat", "mistral-7b-instruct"]
                      Model names as they appear in LM Studio interface
                      Empty list if no models loaded or service unavailable
        
        LM Studio Model Lifecycle:
        ==========================
        
        **Model Loading States**:
        - Unloaded: Model file available but not in memory
        - Loading: Model being loaded into memory (10-60 seconds)
        - Loaded: Model ready for inference requests
        - Unloading: Model being removed from memory
        
        **Dynamic Model Management**:
        - Users can load/unload models via LM Studio GUI
        - Model list changes reflect GUI actions immediately
        - Multiple models can be loaded simultaneously (resource permitting)
        - Automatic unloading when memory pressure occurs
        
        **Model Naming Convention**:
        - Names reflect actual model files and variants
        - May include quantization info (e.g., "model-q4_0")
        - User-friendly names from LM Studio interface
        - Consistent with model selection in GUI
        
        Implementation Notes:
        ====================
        
        **Real-time Updates**: Unlike cloud providers, local model lists
        can change frequently as users manage models in the GUI:
        
        - Cache duration shorter than cloud providers (5 minutes vs 15)
        - More frequent polling acceptable due to local network speed
        - Immediate cache invalidation on certain errors
        
        **Resource Awareness**: Model availability tied to system resources:
        
        - Large models may not load on insufficient memory systems
        - GPU/CPU capability affects model performance
        - Model list reflects current hardware constraints
        
        **Error Handling**: Enhanced for local deployment scenarios:
        
        - Connection refused: LM Studio service not running
        - Empty list: No models loaded (common in fresh installs)
        - Timeout: Service overloaded or unresponsive
        - Resource errors: Insufficient memory for model loading
        
        Example Usage:
        =============
        
        ```python
        # Check what models are currently available
        models = await provider.list_models()
        print(f"Loaded models: {models}")
        
        # Wait for model to be loaded manually
        while not models:
            print("No models loaded. Please load a model in LM Studio...")
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
            models = await provider.list_models()
        
        # Use first available model
        if models:
            response = await provider.complete(messages, models[0])
        
        # Model availability checking
        preferred_model = "llama-2-7b-chat"
        if preferred_model in models:
            # Use preferred model
            response = await provider.complete(messages, preferred_model)
        else:
            # Fall back to any available model
            response = await provider.complete(messages, models[0])
        ```
        
        Monitoring Integration:
        ======================
        
        ```python
        # Monitor model availability
        async def monitor_models():
            while True:
                models = await provider.list_models()
                metrics.gauge("lm_studio_models_loaded", len(models))
                if not models:
                    alert("No models loaded in LM Studio")
                await asyncio.sleep(60)
        
        # Model change detection
        previous_models = set()
        current_models = set(await provider.list_models())
        if current_models != previous_models:
            logger.info(f"Model change detected: {current_models}")
            previous_models = current_models
        ```
        
        Troubleshooting Guide:
        =====================
        
        **Empty Model List**:
        1. Verify LM Studio is running
        2. Check if any models are loaded in the GUI
        3. Ensure models have finished loading (not in loading state)
        4. Verify sufficient system memory for model
        
        **Connection Errors**:
        1. Confirm LM Studio server is enabled
        2. Check port configuration (default 1234)
        3. Verify firewall allows localhost connections
        4. Test with browser: http://localhost:1234/v1/models

        detection and troubleshooting guidance.
        
        Returns:
            bool: True if LM Studio is healthy and operational
                 False if any health issues detected
        
        Enhanced Health Criteria:
        =========================
        
        **Service Availability**:
        - LM Studio application is running
        - API server is enabled and responding
        - Correct port configuration and accessibility
        
        **Model Readiness**:
        - At least one model is loaded and ready
        - Models have completed loading process
        - Sufficient system resources for inference
        
        **Performance Baseline**:
        - API response times within acceptable range
        - No resource exhaustion indicators
        - Service stability and responsiveness
        
        Local Deployment Considerations:
        ===============================
        
        **Resource Monitoring**:
        - Memory usage and availability
        - GPU utilization and accessibility
        - CPU performance and thermal status
        
        **Service State Detection**:
        - Application launch state
        - API server configuration
        - Model loading status and progress
        
        **Network Configuration**:
        - Localhost accessibility
        - Port binding and availability
        - Firewall and security settings
        
        Troubleshooting Integration:
        ===========================
        
        Enhanced error detection provides specific guidance:
        
        **Service Issues**:
        ```
        Health check failed: LM Studio not running
        → Start LM Studio application
        → Enable "Start Server" in LM Studio settings
        → Check port 1234 is not in use by other applications
        ```
        
        **Model Issues**:
        ```
        Health check failed: No models loaded
        → Open LM Studio and load a model from the model library
        → Wait for model loading to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)
        → Ensure sufficient RAM for the selected model
        ```
        
        **Resource Issues**:
        ```
        Health check failed: Service timeout
        → Check system memory usage (models require 4-40GB)
        → Verify GPU drivers are installed and functional
        → Close other memory-intensive applications
        ```
        
        Example Usage:
        =============
        
        ```python
        # Basic health monitoring
        if await provider.health_check():
            print("✓ LM Studio ready for requests")
        else:
            print("✗ LM Studio health check failed")
        
        # Startup validation
        print("Checking LM Studio status...")
        max_attempts = 12  # 1 minute with 5-second intervals
        for attempt in range(max_attempts):
            if await provider.health_check():
                print("✓ LM Studio is ready!")
                break
            print(f"Waiting for LM Studio... ({attempt + 1}/{max_attempts})")
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
        else:
            print("✗ LM Studio failed to become ready")
        
        # Continuous monitoring
        async def monitor_lm_studio():
            while True:
                healthy = await provider.health_check()
                if healthy:
                    logger.debug("LM Studio health check: PASS")
                else:
                    logger.warning("LM Studio health check: FAIL")
                    # Could trigger alerts or fallback providers
                await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
        ```
        
        Integration with Provider Selection:
        ===================================
        
        ```python
        # Multi-provider fallback with local preference
        async def get_best_provider():
            # Prefer local LM Studio for privacy/cost
            if await lm_studio_provider.health_check():
                return lm_studio_provider
            
            # Fall back to cloud providers
            if await openai_provider.health_check():
                return openai_provider
            
            raise RuntimeError("No healthy providers available")
        ```
